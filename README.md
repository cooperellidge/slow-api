# slow-api

This is not production-ready... and is intended never to be.
It is simply me playing around with ASGI implementations.

SlowAPI is a barebones, featureless ASGI application framework inspired by FastAPI.
This project was created as an exercise to learn more about HTTP servers, web application frameworks, and async Python.

An upcoming project is to create an ASGI server, inspired by `uvicorn`, to parse HTTP to ASGI then consumed by apps made with SlowAPI.
